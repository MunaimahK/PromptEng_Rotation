    Rotate the variable and ask for the following variables {M, v1}:

    ask for M

    A rubber bullet of mass m = 0.15 \mathrm{kg} traveling at velocity v_0 = 45 \mathrm{m/s} hits an iron block initially hanging at rest from a massless rope. After the collision, the bullet bounced straight back at a velocity of v_1 = 39 \mathrm{m/s}. The effect of gravity on the bullet alone can be ignored. What is the mass M of the iron block if it reaches a height of h = 2 \mathrm{m} after the collision? (Assume that the rope remains tight during the entire process). Retain your final answer to 2 decimal places.

    ask for v1

    A rubber bullet of mass m = 0.23 \mathrm{kg} traveling at velocity v_0 hits an iron block of mass M = 2.95 \mathrm{kg} initially hanging at rest from a massless rope. After the collision, the bullet bounced straight back at a velocity of v_1 = 56 \mathrm{m/s}. The effect of gravity on the bullet alone can be ignored. What is the incoming speed of the bullet v_0 before it hits the iron block which reaches a height of h = 2.1 \mathrm{m} after the collision?

    Here is a new problem: A rubber bullet of mass m = 0.035 \mathrm{kg} traveling at velocity v_0 = 35 \mathrm{m/s} hits a wooden block of mass M = 5 \mathrm{kg} initially hanging at rest from a massless rope.
