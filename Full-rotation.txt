I am trying to rotate variables of a physics problem and place all rotated variable problems and its associated information into a JSON Structure. Store key information of a physics problem in JSON strcuture. The JSON includes a key for the id number, problem text, the answer, what varaible the problem solves for, an svg image, and a section for a wolfram alpha string. The wolfram alpha string is left blank.

the empty JSON looks like this:

{
            "id":"",
            "problem-text":"",
            "solution":"",
            "solves-for":"",
            "svg-img":"",
            "wolfram-alpha-string":"",
}

Here is an example

A rubber bullet of mass m = 0.23 \mathrm{kg} traveling at velocity v_0 hits an iron block of mass M = 2.95 \mathrm{kg} initially hanging at rest from a massless rope. After the collision, the bullet bounced straight back at a velocity of v_1 = 56 \mathrm{m/s}. The effect of gravity on the bullet alone can be ignored. What is the incoming speed of the bullet v_0 before it hits the iron block which reaches a height of h = 2.1 \mathrm{m} after the collision? (Assume that the rope remains tight during the entire process). Retain your final answer to 2 decimal places.

The variable list is m, v_0, M, v_1, and h

Perform rotation on m, v_1, M, and h

ask h and store in JSON.

A rubber bullet of mass m = 0.25 \mathrm{kg} traveling at velocity v1 = 50 \mathrm{m/s} hits an iron block of mass M = 15 \mathrm{kg} initially hanging at rest from a massless rope. After the collision, the bullet bounced straight back at a velocity of v2 = 35 \mathrm{m/s}. The effect of gravity on the bullet alone can be ignored. To what maximum height h will the iron block reach after the collision?  (Assume that the rope remains tight during the entire process). Retain your final answer to 2 decimal places.

            "id":"",
            "problem-text":"A rubber bullet of mass m = 0.25 \mathrm{kg} traveling at velocity v1 = 50 \mathrm{m/s} hits an iron block of mass M = 15 \mathrm{kg} initially hanging at rest from a massless rope.

            "solves-for":"h",
            "svg-img":"",

}

ask m and store in JSON then ask v_1 and store in a separate JSON then ask M and store in a separate JSON
