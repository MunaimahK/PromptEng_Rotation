PROMPT:

I am trying to rotate variables of a physics problem and place all rotated variable problems and its associated information into a JSON Structure. Store key information of a physics problem in JSON strcuture. The JSON includes a key for the id number, problem text, the answer, what varaible the problem solves for, an svg image, and a section for a wolfram alpha string. The wolfram alpha string is left blank.

the empty JSON looks like this:

{
            "id":"",
            "problem-text":"",
            "solution":"",
            "solves-for":"",
            "svg-img":"",
            "wolfram-alpha-string":"",
}

Here is an example

A mechanical system consisting of the thin rod, a solid disk, and a small solid puck all fixed together is rotating around a single frictionless axis at angular velocity \omega shown in the figure. The axis is located at the center of the disk and is at a distance d away from the near end of the thin rod. The mass of the rod is M_r and the length of the rod is L, while the mass of the disk is M_D and the radius of the disk is R. The small puck can be seen as a point particle of mass m which is fixed to the thin rod at distance l away from the pivot, as shown in the figure. What is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the puck-rod-disk system? 

The variable list is omega, d, M_r, L, M_D, R, and m

Perform rotation on d, M_r, L, M_D, R, and m

ask d and store in JSON.

ask m and store in JSON then ask M_r and store in a separate JSON then ask L and store in a separate JSON then ask M_D and store in a separate JSON then ask R and store in a separate JSON
